trying luck with jenkins web hook
-> changed branch name in jenkins
-> triggered manual build the first time to test for webhook on subsequent builds
-> replacing bat with sh. -> as I am deploying to an ubuntu server using a shell, if deploying toa  windows server , can use bat
-> checking jenkins directory
-> adding timeout


-> for service creation and visudo refer https://faun.pub/net-core-projects-ci-cd-with-jenkins-ubuntu-and-nginx-642aa9d272c9
